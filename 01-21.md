# Container Classes Implementations

## The Bag Class

### The value_type must have a default constructor

- The `value_type` is used as the component type of an array in the private member variable:

```
class bag{
	//...

	private:
		value_type data[CAPACITY]; // An array to store items
	
	//...
};
```

- If the `value_type` is a class with constructors (rather than one of the C++ built-in types), then the compiler must initialize each component of the data array using the item's **default constructor**
- This is why our bag documentation includes the statement that "the `value_type` type must be "a class with a default constructor..."
- When an array has a component type that is a class, **the compiler uses the default constructor** to initialize the array components

### The Invariant of a Class

- We need to state **how the member variables of the bag class are used** to represent a bag of items
- There are two rules for our bag implementation
	- The number of items in the bag is stored in the member variable `used`
	- for an empty bag, we do not care what is stored in any of `data` for a non-empty bag, the items in the bag are stored in `data[0]` through `data[used-1]`, and we don't care what is stored in the rest of the data
- The rules that dictate how the member variables of a class represent a value (such as a bag of items) are called the **invariant** of the class
- With the exception of the constructors, **each function depends on the invariant being valid when the function is called**
- And each function, including the constructors, has a responsibility of ensuring that the invariant is valid when the function finishes
- The **invariant of a class** is a condition that is **an implicit part of every function's postcondition**
- The invariant **is not usually written as an explicit part of the preconditions and postconditions** because the programmer who uses the class does not need to know about these conditions
- The invariant is a critical part of the implementation of a class, but it has no effect on the way the class is used

### The Bag Class Implementation - The Value Semantics

- Our documentation indicates that **assignments and the copy constructor may be used with a bag**
- Our plan is to use the **automatic assignment operator** and the **automatic copy constructor**, each of which simply copies the member variables from one bag to another
- This is fine because **the copying process will copy both the data array and the member variable** `used`
- Ecample: If a programmer has two bags `x` and `y`, then the statement `y=x` will invoke the automatic assignment operator to copy all of `x.data` to `y.data`, and to copy `x.used` to `y.used`
- Our only "work" for the value semantics is confirming that the automatic operations are correct

### Header File for the Bag Class

```
#ifndef SCU_coen79_BAG1_H
#define SCU_coen79_BAG1_H
#include <cstdlib> //provides size_t

namespace scu_coen79_3{
	class bag{

		public:
			//TYPEDEFS and MEMBER CONSTANTS
			typedef int value_type;
			typedef std::size_t size_type;
			static const size_type CAPACITY = 30;

			//CONSTRUCTOR
			bag() {used = 0;};

			//MODIFICATION MEMBER FUNCTIONS
			size_type erase(const value_type& target);
			bool erase_one(const value_type& target);
			void insert(const value_type& entry);
			void operator +=(const bag& addend);

			//CONSTANT MEMBER FUNCTIONS
			size_type size() const {return used;};
			size_type count(const value_type& target) const;

		private:
			value_type data[CAPACITY]; //The array to store items
			size_type used;            //How much of array is used
	};

	//NONMEMBER FUNCTIONS for the bag class
	bag operator +(const bag& b1, const bag& b2);
}

#endif
```

### The Bag Class Implementation - The Count Member Function

- To count **the number of occurrences of a particular item** in a bag, we step through the used portion of the partially filled array
- Remember that we are using locations `data[0]` through `data[used-1]`, so the correct loop is:

```
bag::size_type bag::count(const value_type& target) const{
	size_type answer;
	size_type i;
	answer = 0;

	for(i = 0; i < used, ++i){
		if(target == data[i]) ++answer;
	}

	return answer;
}
```

### The Bag Class Implementation - Needing to use the Full Type Name

- When we implement the `count` function, we must take care to write the return type:

```
bag::size_type bag::count(const value_type& target) const;
```

- We have used the completely specified type `bag::size_type` rather than just `size_type`
	- Because many compiler do not recognize that you are implementing a bag member functino until after seeing `bag::count`
- In the implementation, after `bag::count`, we may use simpler names such as `size_type` and `value_type`
- However, before `bag::count`, we should use the full type name `bag::size_type`

### The Bag Class Implementation - The Insert member function

- The `insert` function checks that there is room to insert a new item
- The next available location is `data[used]`
- Example: If `used=3`, then `data[0]`, `data[1]`, and `data[2]` are already occupied, and the next location is `data[3]`

```
void bag::insert(const value_type& entry){
	//Library facilities used: cassert

	assert(size() < CAPACITY);

	data[used] = entry;
	++used;
}
```

- Note: within a member function we can refer to the static member constant `CAPACITY` with no extra notation

### The Bag Class Implementation - The Erase_One member function

- How the `erase_one` function removes an item name `target` from a bag?
	1. We find the index of `target` in the bag's array, and store this index in a local variable named `index`
	2. Take the final item in the bag and copy it to `data[index]`
		- The final item is copied onto the item that we are removing
		- The reason for this copying is so that all the bag's items stay together at the front of the partially filled array, with no holes
	3. Reduce the value of `used` by one - in effect reducing the used part of the array by one
		- The value of `used` is reduced by one to indicate that one item has been removed

```
bool bag::erase_one(const value_type& target){
	size_type index;

	index = 0;
	while((index < used) && (data[index] != target)){
		++index;
	}

	if(index == used) return false;

	--used;
	data[index] = data[used];
	return true;
}
```

- C++ uses **short-circuit evaluation** to evaluate boolean expressions
- In short-circuit evaluation: A boolean expression is evaluated from left to right, **and the evaluation stops as soon as there is enough information to determine the value of the expression**

### The Bag Class Implementation - The operator +=

- The implementation is as follows:

```
void bag::operator +=(const bag& addend){
	//...

	for(i = 0; i < number of items to copy; ++i){
		data[used] = addend.data[i];
		++used;
	}
}
```

- To avoid an explicit loop **we can used the copy functino from the <algorithm> Standard Library**

### An Object can be an Argument to its Own Member Function

- **Pitfall:** The same variable is sometimes used on both sides of an assignment or other operator
	- Example:

```
bag b;
b.insert(5);
b.insert(2);
b += b;
```

- In the `+=` statement, the bag `b` is activating the `+=` operator, but this smae bag `b` is the actual argument to the operator
- This is a situatino that must be carefully tested
- **Example of the danger:** Consider the **incorrect** implementation of +=

```
void bag::operator +=(const bag& addend){
	size_type i;

	assert(size() + addend.size() <= CAPACITY);
	for(i = 0; i < addend.used; ++i){
		data[used] = addend.data[i];
		++used;
	}
}
```

- If we activate `b+=b` then the private member variable used is the same variable as `addend.used`
- Each iteration of the loop adds 1 to `used`, and hence `addend.used` is also increasing, and the loop never ends
- What is the solution?

### The Copy Function from the C++ Standard Library

- The Standard Library contains a **copy function** for easy copying of items from one location to another
- The function is part of the `std` namespace in the `<algorithm<` facility:

```
copy(<beginning location>, <ending location>, <destination>);
```

- It continues beyond the beginning location, copying more and more items to the next spot of the destination, until we are about to copy the ending location - **The ending location is not copied**
- This implementation uses the `copy` functino from the `<algorithm>` Standard Library

```
void bag::operator +=(const bag& addend){

	assert(size() + addend.size() <= CAPACITY);

	copy(addend.data, addend.data + addend.used, data+used);

	used += addend.used;
}
```

### The Bag Class Implementation - The Operator +

- The `operator+` is **an ordinary function** rather than a member function
- The function must take two bags, add them together into a third bag, and return this **third bag**

```
bag operator +(const bag& b1, const bag& b2){
	bag answer;

	assert(b1.size() + b2.size() <= bag::CAPACITY);

	answer += b1;
	answer += b2;
	return answer;
}
```

- Does this function need to be a friend function of the bag class?
	- No, we are not using any private members

### The Bag Class Implementation - The Erase member function

- The `erase` function **removes all copies of target** from the bag and returns the number of copies removed

```
bag::size_type bag::erase(const value_type& target){
	size_type index = 0;
	size_type many_removed = 0;

	while(index < used){
		if(data[index] == target){
			--used;
			data[index] = data[used];
			++many_removed;
		}
		else ++index;
	}

	return many_removed;
}
```

### Document Class Invariant in the Implementation File

- The best place to document the class's invariant is at the top of the implementation file
- In particular, do not write the invariant in the header file, **because a programmer who uses the class does not need to know about how the invariant dictates the use of private fields**
- But the programmer who implements the class does need to know about the invariant

### The Bag Class - Analysis

- We'll use the number of items in a bag as the input size for the time analysis
- To count the operations, we'll count the number of statements executed by the function, although we won't need an exact count since our answer will use *big-O* notation
- All of the work in `count()` happens in this loop:

```
for(i = 0; i < used; ++i){
	if(target == data[i]) ++answer;
}
```

- The body of the loop will be executed exactly `n` times
- The time expression is always O(n)

### Time Analysis for the Bag Functions

|Operation          |Time Analysis                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Default constructor|O(1) (consant time)                             |
|count              |O(n) (n is the size of the bag)                 |
|erase_one          |O(n) (linear time)                              |
|erase              |O(n) (linear time)                              |
|+= another bag     |O(n) (n is the size of the other bag)           |
|b1 + b2            |O(n1 + n2) (n1 and n2 are the sizes of the bags)|
|insert             |O(1) (constant time)                            |
|size               |O(1) (constant time)                            |

- `erase_one` sometimes requires fewer than `n * (number of statements in the loop)`; however, this does not change the fact that the function is O(n)
- In the worst case, the loop does execute a full `n` iterations, therefore the correct time analysis is no better than O(n)
- Several of the other bag functions do not contain any loops at all, and do not call any functions with loops
	- Example, when an item is added to a bag, the new item is always placed at the end of the array

# Summary

- A **container class** is a class where each object contains a collection of items
	- Examples: Bags and sequences classes
- `typedef` statement makes it easy to alter the data type of the underlying items
- The simplest implementations of container classes use a **partially filled array**, which requires each object to have at least two member variables:
	- The array
	- A variable to keep track of how much of the array is being used
- At the top of the implementation file: When you design a class, always make an explicit statement of the rules (**invariant of the class**) that dictate how the member variables are used
