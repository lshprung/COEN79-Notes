# Virtual Member Functions

## Example

```
class person{
	public:
		person(std::string name = "empty", int age = 0){
			this->name = name;
			this->age = age;
		}

		void print_name() const {
			std::cout << "Name is: " << get_name() << std::endl;
		}
	
	protected:
		std::string get_name() const { return name; };

	private:
		std::string name;
		int age;
};

class professor : public person{
	public:
		professor(std::string name = "empty", int age = 40, double salary = 0, bool nice = true) : person(name, age), salary(salary), nice(nice){};

		//Overriding the get_name function
		//Now this is a public function of this class
		std::string get_name() const{
			return (person::get_name() + ", he is nice!");
		}

	private:
		double salary;
		bool nice;
};

int main(int argc, const char* argv[]){
	professor myProf("Ben", 36);
	myProf.print_name();
	return 0;
}

---

//The output is:
Name is: Ben
```

## An example with a virtual

```
class person{
	public:
		person(std::string name = "empty", int age = 0){
			this->name = name;
			this->age = age;
		}

		void print_name() const {
			std::cout << "Name is: " << get_name() << std::endl;
		}
	
	protected:
		//This is a virtual now!!!
		virtual std::string get_name() const { return name; };

	private:
		std::string name;
		int age;
};

class professor : public person{
	public:
		professor(std::string name = "empty", int age = 40, double salary = 0, bool nice = true) : person(name, age), salary(salary), nice(nice){};

		//Overriding the get_name function
		//Now this is a public function of this class
		std::string get_name() const{
			return (person::get_name() + ", he is nice!");
		}

	private:
		double salary;
		bool nice;
};

int main(int argc, const char* argv[]){
	professor myProf("Ben", 36);
	myProf.print_name();
	return 0;
}
```

- If we use `virtual std::string get_name() const { return name; };`, then the output is:
	- `Name is: Ben, he is nice!`

- If we use `std::string get_name() const { return name; };`, then the output is:
	- `Name is: Ben`

## Example: game Class

- **Virtual member functions** are a new kind of member function that allows certain aspects of activating a function to be delayed until a program is actually running
- To make the explanation of virtual functions concrete, we'll present an example of a class called **game**, which will mke it easier for us to write programs that play various two-player games such as chess, checkers, or Othello

```
class game{
	public:
		//ENUM TYPE
		enum who { HUMAN, NEUTRAL, COMPUTER }; //Possible game outcomes

		//CONSTRUCTOR and DESTRUCTOR
		game() { move_number = 0; };
		virtual ~game() {};

		//PUBLIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS
		//The play function should not be overridden. It plays once game, with the human player moving first and the computer second
		//The computer uses an alpha-beta look ahead algorithm to select its moves. The return value is the winner of the game (or NEUTRAL for a tie)
		who play();

	protected:
		//OPTIONAL VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS (overriding these is optional)
		virtual void display_message(const std::string& message) const;
		virtual std::string get_user_move() const;
		virtual who last_mover() const { return (move_number % 2 == 1 ? HUMAN : COMPUTER); };
		virtual int moves_completed() const { return move_number; };
		virtual who next_mover() const { return (move_number % 2 == 0 ? HUMAN : COMPUTER); };
		virtual who opposite(who player) const { return (player == HUMAN ? COMPUTER : HUMAN); };
		virtual who winning() const;

		//VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS THAT MUST BE OVERRIDDEND (The overriding function function should call the original when it finishes)
		//Have the next player make a specified move:
		virtual void make_move(const std::string& move) { ++move_number; };
		//Restart the game from the beginning:
		virtual void restart() { move_number = 0; };

		//PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS (these must be provided for each derived class
		//Return a pointer to a copy of myself:
		virtual game* clone() const = 0;
		//Computer all the moves that the next player can make:
		virtual void computer_moves(std::queue<std::string>& moves) const = 0;
		//A pure virtual function is indicated by "= 0" before the end of the semicolon in the prototype
		//The class does not provide any implementation of a pure virtual function

	private:
		//MEMBER VARIABLES
		int move_number; //Number of moves made so far
		//...
};
```

## Protected Members

```
protected:
	//OPTIONAL VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS (overriding these is optional)
	virtual void display_message (const std::string& message) const;
```

- The keyword **protected** indicates that the items that follow will be a new kind of member, somewhat between *public* and *private*
- A protected member can be used (and overridden) by a derived class - but apart from within a derived class, any protected member is private; It cannot be used elsewhere

## Virtual Member Functions

- The first protected member function in the game class is `display_message`

```
game::who game::play(){
	display_message("Welcome!");
	...
}
```

- When we play the game, the welcome message is printed at the start
- But, suppose that we write a game that needs to display messages by some other method
- Our derived class will inherit all the game class members, but it can override any method that it doesn't like

- Perhaps we want our Connect Four game to print "\*\*\*" before each displayed message (just to make the messages more exciting)
- We could override the `display_message` function so that `connect4::display_message` first prints "\*\*\*" and then prints the message
- With this approach, when the `play` method begins, it will activate `display_message("Welcome!")`, but what will this print?
	- If it uses `game::display_message`, then the word "Welcome!" appears by itself
	- If it uses `connect4::display_message`, then "\*\*\*Welcome!"

### When Onve Member Function Activates Another

- Normally, when a member function `f()` activates another member function `g()`, the version of `g()` that is actually activated comes from the same class as the function `f()`
- This behavior occurs even if the activated function `g` is later overridden, and `f` is activated by an object of the derived class
- In this example, this means that `game::play` normally would use `game::display_message`, even if a derived object activates the play method
- Solution: use "**virtual**"

### Activating a Virtual Member Function

- Whenever a **virtual** member function is activated, **the data type of the activating object is examined when the program is running**, and the correct version of the function is used
- For a virtual member function, the choice of which version of the function to use is never made until the program is running
- At run time, **the program examines the data type of the object** that activated the method, and thereby uses the correct version of the function

### Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

- A pure virtual function is indicated by "= 0" before the end of the semicolon in the prototype
- The class does not provide any implementation of a pure virtual function
- Because there is no implementation, any class with a pure virtual function is called an **abstract class** and **no instances of an abstract class may appear in a program**
- Abstract classes are used as base classes, and it is up to the derived class to provide an implementation for each pure virtual function

## Summary

- Object-oriented programming supports reusable components by permitting new derived classes to be declared, which automatically inherit all members of an existing base class
- All members of a base class are inherited by the derived class, but only the non-private members of the base class can be accessed by the programmer who implements the derived class
- The connection between a derived class and its base class can often be characterized by the "is-a" relationship
- An abstract base class (such as the game class) can provide a common framework that is needed by many derived classes
- An abstract base class has one or more pure virtual functions, which are functions that must be overridden before the class can be used
